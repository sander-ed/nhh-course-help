## But Why?

If you've chanced upon this GitHub repository, then you're likely in the same situation I found myself in back in August 2022. Like a ship sailing through the fog, I was navigating the uncharted waters of choosing a major for my masters degree at NHH. My resources were limited, as I knew very few people who had undertaken either major, and the information available on the NHH homepage left much to be desired.

I remember vividly the frustration I felt. I believed that I hadn't reached my full potential during my bachelor's years, and I was yearning for a fresh jolt of motivation. I wanted to be sure of my next step; I wanted to ensure that I was making the right choice for my Masters at NHH.

As luck would have it, I managed to connect with two fellow students who had just completed their first year in the BAN major. In the nick of time, just days before the BAN420 started in the second week of the semester, I was able to ask them some insightful questions.

Their responses were a game-changer. From there, I managed to get a firm grip on the courses and found myself reinvigorated, finally engaged in something that truly excited me academically. I was no longer just 'going through the motions'; I was actively shaping my future.

From that point, I made a promise to myself to help the "next wave" of students. I wanted to make their journey a bit easier. My plan was to share my own experiences, write up course reviews, and give a heads-up on which courses might be worth a look. Just one year ago, I knew nothing about any of this. The lack of information almost made me pass up the BAN major, which would have changed my life at NHH completely.

So, I've put together this repository, hoping it will help others. If I can make the major-selection process even a bit easier for just one student, I'll feel like I've done my job. The help I got was invaluable, and I believe it's my turn to help out in return.
