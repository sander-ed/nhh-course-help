# Disclaimer Data Master's Thesis

The data used for our masters thesis were provided to us by Norwegian Analyst companies who usually locks these reports behind pay-walls and otherwise limit their accessibility. We are therefore not able to publish the raw data sets for further use, although the companies and time-frames we used for our analysis is specified in our thesis, thus making it possible to replicate our results given that a new user has been granted access to the same data by the analyst companies.
