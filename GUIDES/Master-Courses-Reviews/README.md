This scale will be used to grade the various aspects of each course. The scores of the courses are weighed against each other. If a course has <span style="color:#5ae342">Low</span> course **Coursework Amount**, it does not mean that is has no coursework, just that is is low compared to the other possible courses which has been rated. The final review score is based upon my personal preference, and how much I enjoyed taking the course.
