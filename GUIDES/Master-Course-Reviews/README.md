# Choosing courses for BAN master

Choosing courses for the Business Analytics major at NHH can be a difficult task which I personally experienced in August of 2022. As I knew very few people who had taken BAN as a major before I chose it as my major, I had a lot of questions which was left unanswered before the first lectures of BAN420. This **GUIDES** section of the GitHub-page is therefore dedicated to reviewing the courses I have taken, and explaining their various ins-and-outs which might make it easier to choose the ones that fit you, and making it easier to choose this techincal, but extremely fulfilling and useful major at NHH.

I have chosen to rate the various courses I have taken on several criteria in order to make it somewhat fair.

- Learning Outcome
- Coursework Amount
- Difficulty
- Required Code Knowledge
- Lecture Quality

I have also added a final score, and a section explaining the exam form.

Some categories are more important than others however. The learning outcome is extremely important to consider when choosing the BAN major, as there are many transferrable skills which can be applied to other courses. For example, I would have struggled a lot more with the descriptive statistics in STR459 had it not been for BAN432, and the thoroughness required to complete BAN402 made other courses like BAN400 seem less intimidating. All other categories somewhat speak for themselves.

The categories are divided into diffrent scores, on a range from ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$ to ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$.

**Category Scores**

| $${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$$ | $${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$$ | $${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$$ | $${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$$ |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------- |

This scale will be used to grade the various aspects of each course. The scores of the courses are weighed against each other. If a course has ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$ **Coursework Amount**, it does not mean that is has no coursework, just that is is low compared to the other possible courses which has been rated. The final review score is based upon my personal preference, and how much I enjoyed taking the course.

The courses I have taken at the masters level at NHH are the following:

## Course Ratings

## **[BAN400](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/r-programming-for-data-science/?displayNextTerm=True) - R Programming for Data Science**

BAN400 is acts as the introduction to data science at the masters level at NHH. It makes use of the open-source programming languange R in order to wrangle data sets, create graphic representations of data and give an introduction to bootstrapping and tree based machine learning models. R is familiar to students who took their bachelor degree at NHH, as it is one of the main tools used in the course MET4.

### Learning Outcome

**Rating:** ${\color{#e01010}VERY HIGH}$

The skills learning through this course was essential on my journey from programming and data science novice to a person who takes great interest in this subject area, and really sparked my enjoyment and interest in programming as a whole. I have used the things I learned in this course both directly and indirectly in all my other exams in my degree thus far.

### Coursework Amount

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

In order to be eligable for an exam in this course, you both needed to pass BAN420 (which in of itself was a 2.5 ECTS course) and complete 6 of 8 assignments during the semester. This might seem overwhelming, but the difficulty of the assignments were not very high, while they "forced" me to work on the course during the semester, which in hindsight is what increased my skill level neccesary to achieve an A in the course.

**! Note**: _BAN420 is no longer offered as of Fall 2023, which might change the course structure in this regard._

### Difficulty

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

I have chosen to rate the difficulty to medium, as much of the course was not very challenging. The challenge was the amount of work which had to be completed. I also found the exam we had (Fall 2022) to be above average difficulty, and much more difficult than the one used for the Fall 2021 exam (Which I used as exercice during my exam prep).

### Required Code Knowledge

**Rating:** ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$

This course is a "from-zero-to-hero" course, in the sense that it assumes no previous knowledge of the subjects which are gone through. Although basic code understanding is very useful in order to get started on the course material, it is not at all required. Many co-students I talked to went from almost no knowledge of programming to getting an A in this course.

### Lecture Quality

**Rating:** ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$

The lectures in this course really are the gold standard of lectures at NHH. Although it is hard to give credit to only one person for designing a course, the professor _[Håkon Otneim](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/hakon-otneim/)_ really is a gifted educator, and his passion is really evident throughout the various course material. I really felt like the professors wanted me to become great at a field they loved. It is no suprise he recently won the _[Inspirational Teaching Award](https://www.nhh.no/nhh-bulletin/artikkelarkiv/2022/juni/nhh-forskere-fikk-undervisningspris-pa-250-000-kroner/)_ award for innovative and overall great teaching at NHH.

### Exam

**Group Exam:** No

The exam was a 2,5 day exam at the end of December, in which a task was handed out individually at 09:00 on a monday, and was due at 14:15 the following wednesday. I really liked this format, which allowed me to be "stuck" at some parts and still prevail.

Exam Grade: **A**

### Review Summary

**Review Score:** ${\textbf{9/10}}$

Having had many courses at NHH, I can honestly not reccomend this course enough. The only reason it has one less point than perfect is the fact that it might be difficult to combine with other majors, as it has a heavy courseload and requires a lot of attention to succeed. Other than that, I can only say positive things of this course if you are a prospective BAN student.

### **BAN400 Grade Distribution Fall 2022**

## **[BAN402](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/decision-modelling-in-business/) - Decision Modelling in Business**

BAN402 serves as an introduction to optimization at the masters level. The course is divided into three parts, each of which comes with their own 1 week exam. The three parts were Linear Programming, Integer and Mixed-Integer Models and Non-linear programming. IF you have taken BED4 at the bachelor level at NHH, you have gotten a taste of optimization, although this course takes it to another level. The main tool used in this course is [AMPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPL), a [algebraic modeling language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_modeling_language) which is a language designed for solving mathematical tasks. You use of the solvers IBM Cplex, Gurobi and MINOS to solve optimization tasks during the course, based on the problems you are solving.

### Learning Outcomes

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

This course dives relatively deep into real world use-cases for optimization, and I believe that you will get a above average understanding of how optimization is used, and how to use if if you take this course. It is also one of the most popular topics for writing your BAN master thesis. What pulls it down it that although the skills aquired in this course are very useful, they are not very transferrable to other courses in the BAN profile.

### Coursework Amount

**Rating:** ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$

Let's adress the elephant in the room. Yes, the amount of coursework needed to complete this course are is very high, if not more. The three weeks you spend solving the exams for this course are gruelling, and you will feel like you understand around 20% of everything you do during this time. When people say that the BAN profile is a heavy major, they are most likely referring to this course. On a positive note, you will feel an extreme sense of accomplishment when you deliver the third exam in this course, which personally made me feel like I could take on the world. If you want to get a better grasp of the type of work you will be doing, take at [my exam answer](https://github.com/sander-ed/nhh-course-help/tree/main/MASTER/BAN402/exam-H22-A) from this course.

### Difficulty

**Rating:** ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$

Although the ideas at the centre of this course is relatively simple, the tasks which you will solve feel borderline impossible sometimes. On a positive note, if you feel like something is impossibly hard, your co-students will most likely feel the same, and in my experience you will be compensated in the grading of the exam.

### Required Code Knowledge

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

You do not need to know much code, as the AMPL language is highly mathematical in nature (the syntax is almost identical to actual optimization math notation). There was some tasks however which required you to use R or Python for a descriptive statistics part, which made me put this rating at medium.

### Lecture Quality

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

The professor in this course was _[Mario Guajardo](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/mario-guajardo/)_, who is an extremely talented researcher, and getting his insight into optimization was extremely helpful in understanding the practical application of the course material. On the other hand, the lectures were highly techincal, and I learned how to solve the tasks in the exam doing my own research, whilst attending very few lectures.

### Exam

**Group Exam:** Yes

The exam was split into three parts in groups of two. You could change partners during the course, but it was reccomended that you kept the same partner throughout. The first exam was from 15.09.2022 to 23.09.2022, the second exam was from 11.10.2022 to 19.10.2022 and the third exam was 01.11.2022 to 09.11.2022. The second exam was by far the most difficult, so don't make my mistake of being the group leader of Video at the SL Bergen Challange and being admitted to the hospital during this second exam🙃
The exams were not graded individually, but together after the last exam, which led to a lot of tension, as you would have no idea of how well the exams went throughout the semester.

Exam Grade: **A**

### Review Summary

**Review Score:** ${\textbf{7/10}}$

This course is the BAN majors "trial-by-fire" in my opinion, which might be seen as a bad thing by some. I believe that although it is tough, it is somewhing that makes the BAN major unique, as just having gone through this course with a good grade can be seen as a grat accomplishment. The quality of the course might not be top notch, but taking this course is something every BAN student can say they have overcome, which I think is a good thing overall.

### **BAN402 Grade Distribution Fall 2022**

## **[BAN432](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/applied-textual-data-analysis-for-business-and-finance/) - Applied Textual Data Analysis for Business and Finance**

BAN432 is a course which aims to give the student a good understanding of how to process large amounts of text in a structural and useful manner, in order to provide a framework to make better business decisions. You make use of R where you learn to use APIs, use sentiment analysis, tokenization and much more.

### Learning Outcomes

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

This goal of this course is to be able to analyze a large set of text in the form using many tools which is present in nearly all BAN courses at NHH. This was the course where I learned descriptive statistics, web-scraping, API usage, tokenization and many other useful tools. Despite the specific focus of the course being text analysis, which may not be directly applicable to other subjects, I found the knowledge and skills I gained in using the R programming language particularly beneficial. This expertise significantly contributed to my performance in advanced courses, specifically BAN400 and subsequent BAN404.

### Coursework Amount

**Rating:** ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$

In order to be able to take the exam, there was siz individual assignments, one per week for from around week 3 of the semester. At the end of the course, you also needed to hand in two group assignments. The individual assignments took around 2-3 hours to complete each, whilst the group assignments were much larger in scope. My group was not able to hand in more than 50% of the first group assignment as there was so many other mandatory assignments in other courses at the same time. We did manage to hand them in with around 2-3 days work however. The exam also lasted one week, which was quite heavy after having already having completed BAN402. All in all, I rate the coursework amount to Very High, as it felt like a lot when combining it with BAN400 and BAN402. It is not as bad as BAN402 however, but more demanding than BAN400.

### Difficulty

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

Not particularly demanding when it comes to the difficulty of the course material, as most of the course consists of many small introductions to several fields within textual analysis. The main concept which is delved into a bit further than an introduction is sentiment anlsysi, which was very interesting and the basis of our exam. Although it proved a bit challanging, I would denote is as very difficult, which lead to the medium rating.

### Required Code Knowledge

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

The required code knowledge is still quite low, as most of the core concepts of R is fleshed out in the first lecture. I would classify this course as quite challanging if you are completely new to R and programming, but if you take it at the same time as BAN400 they form a king of symbiosis, as working on one course leads to better skills in the other. I would highly reccomend taking this course at the same time as BAN400 as a form of 15 ECTS introduction to R and its applications, with a focus on textual analysis.

### Lecture Quality

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

The lectures was not bad, although they were nothing to write home about. I found it useful to attend most of them, but I stopped at around the halfway mark, and I found that it did not affect my proficiency at the mandatory tasks. One thing to note is that at least one person on a exam group should have attended most of the lectures, as there were a few things which were only explained in the lectures, and not in the lecture slides or documentation which was relevant for the exam!

### Exam

**Group Exam:** Yes

The exam consisted of a teo parts, which were to be completed in 7 days. The groups had 3-4 people in them. The first and main part of the exam was to write a report based on a set of tasks, with quite specific requirements for completion. The second part consisted of making a presentation which were to be presented orally the week after the exam.

Exam Grade: **A**

[Link to my exam in this course](https://github.com/sander-ed/nhh-course-help/tree/main/MASTER/BAN432/exam-H22-A)

### Review Summary

**Review Score:** ${\textbf{7/10}}$

Overall, the course was useful in my progress as a programmer and made we quite skilled in analyzing both textual and general purpose data. I would reccomend to take this course if you are interested in honing your programming skills, as the weekly projects in both this course and BAN400 made working in R a weekly activity, which I believe is the main reason of my A grade in both courses.

## **[BUS401E](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/strategic-profitability-analysis/) - Strategic Profitability Analysis**

This course is structured around a fairly simple business decision of: _What price should we take for this item or service?_. The course is divided into the three parts:

- Strategic Analysis (Profit)
- Costing Analysis (Cost)
- Pricing Analysis (Revenue)
- The Human Factor

By dividing the approach of this questions into several modules, you are taken on a journey which will try to explain how business decisions can impact the revenue, cost and profit of a company, and in turn how the price can impact business decisions.

### Learning Outcomes

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

Although this course is both considered a mandatory course for BUS profile and a possible elective course in the BAN profile, it leanes heavily on the BUS aspects of the course. I believe this should be considered a positive if chosen by a BAN major. I learned a lot about strategic pricing, capital costs, human impact on costs and price theory in this course, which inspired me to create a new capital costs model for the NHH student accociation (NHHS) when aquiring new equipment inteded for long term use, which can be found [here](https://github.com/sander-ed/nhh-course-help/blob/main/MASTER/BUS401E/nhhs-capital-cost/Velferd%20knytet%20til%20store%20engangsinvesteringer%20i%20NHHS.pdf)! (Norwegian). All in all, the course was very useful in furthering my understanding of an important aspect of many business decisions.

### Coursework Amount

**Rating:** ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$

I have rated the coursework amount to Low, as the course approval only consisted of one mandatory group assignment at the end of the semester. Although it was not a small assignment, it is by far the lowest amount of work needed to get course approval in my BAN major thus far.

### Difficulty

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

As this course is mostly theoretical, the difficulty could get quite high at some points. The pricing analys lectures from _[Kenneth Fjell](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/kenneth-fjell/)_ was really challenging at first, which by their own could put this difficulty tier into Very High. On the other hand, there were many sections of the course which I would consider on the easier side, which combined leads me to rate this course as High difficulty.

### Required Code Knowledge

Not applicable, as no programming is used in this course (Although some excel expecience is very useful in some sections of the course)

### Lecture Quality

**Rating:** ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$

I have not taken a course at NHH with such an inspiring professor as _[Joel Berge](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/joel-berge/)_. As the course curriculum and foundation is based upon the Norwegian version of this course **BUS401N**, and is created by my favorite bachelor professor _[Trond Bjørnenak](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/trond-bjornenak/)_, I knew that atleast the course material would be good going into the course. The amount of joy put into the lectures by Joel, with ice cream in the first and last lectures, active learning sessions which he "forced" us to talk to the person beside us, a cultural curriculum which involved playing songs in the breaks between lectures from artists ranging from Kendrick Lamar, The Beatles and Boy Pablo any many more fantastic initatives I was stunned at the amount of fun I had in these lectures. At the same time, he was able to convey a lot of ideas and perspectives around the lecture material which really made me realize some of the deeper though procceses behind the at times dry theory presented in the lectures. I can not praise these lectures enough, and I felt like Joel really cared about teaching us this curriculum. Although the exam grading might seem strict, I have no bad feeling towards this course as I felt that the perspectives gained from attending these lectures weighed up for my somewhat weak motivation to actually really learn this curriculum.

### Exam

**Group Exam:** No

The exam is very similar in structure to the BED-courses at the NHH bachelor, with a certain set of tasks which vary little from year to year. I found the form of the exam to be kind of difficult to re-adapt to after having had a lot of group and report based exams.

Exam Grade: **B**

[Link to my my exam in this course](https://github.com/sander-ed/nhh-course-help/tree/main/MASTER/BUS401E/exam-H22-B)

### Review Summary

**Review Score:** ${\textbf{8/10}}$

This course has its flaws, but because of the widening of my perspective on business decisions, whilst also having top quality lectures, I would recommend this course to pretty much any NHH masters student which is interested in learning more about how businesses "think" and how this is conveyed in the prices of their products.

## **[BAN404](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/predictive-analytics-with-r/) - Predictive Analytics with R**

This course aims to give the students a thorough understanding around some of the most common tools used in real world data science thorugh various applications in R. The curriculum includes bootstrapping, classification models, KNN, Splines, GAM models, Decision and Regression Trees, boosting and bagging, SVM and unsupervised learning. With such an array of topics, this course is bound to be interesting right?

### Learning Outcome

**Result:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

I have put this as high, because the course actually contains a large amount of useful information if you plan to work within data science. How much you actually learn depends heavily on how you approach the exam, which was the main source of my learning. The book (although liked by many of my co-students) was not very good in my opinion, and both the book and lectures made little to no effort to actually convey these topics in an interesting way. At the same time there are no depth in your understanding of these topics, and you need no ability to combine the these topics with eachother to create meaningful analysis. In summary, it was my interest in these topics which made me want to learn more than just the surface level curriculum, not the course itself.

### Coursework Amount

**Rating:** ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$

In order to get course approval you needed to hand in one group assignment in the middle of the semester. I put in very little effort in this, as it had a due date in the middle of the NHH Symposium, in which I was a group leader. I stopped going to the lectures at around the halfway point as well, so in summary I spent very little time during the semester on this course, which was made possible by the low amount of mandatory work needed to get course approval.

### Difficulty

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

This rating is hard to place for me, as the lectures relied heavily on mathemathical expressions, which made it seem more complicated than it actually was. As soon as I started working on the previous exams, the tasks became very easy very fast. Once I had a solid grasp on how to actually apply these concepts, the mathemathical formulations made sense to me. All in all however, as both the book and lectures relies to heavily on the math theory behind all the presented concepts, I believe that the difficulty is rightfully placed at Hard.

### Required Code Knowledge

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

The code used to answer the tasks in the course is based on an the [ISLR](https://www.statlearning.com/) book's approach to R code. One of my largest gripes with this course is that students who previously took BAN400 and BAN432, for example, must "unlearn" key libraries such as dplyr, magrittr, and ggplot in favor of the base R functions. This creates a poor learning environment, in my opinion, as bad habits are formed when taking this course. An example of this is that no pipes are used in this course, which is a significant part of how students learned to code in BAN400, BAN420, and BAN432. I understand that in order to comply with the ISLR book, the style of code must be somewhat consistent. However, given that this is a mandatory course in the BAN profile, I believe it is possible to create an easier transition between the previously named courses and this course. Considering this, I would rate the required code knowledge as high, as starting from scratch in this course may lead you to develop a lot of bad habits in the long run.

### Lecture Quality

**Rating:** ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$

The lectures are very important if you want to grasp most of the concepts, but if you are not willing to spend 2-3 hours before each lecture giving yourself a head start with the curriculum for the given lecture, you might as well not attend, as I didn't understand anything when attending these lectures without preparation. I might be an outlier in this case, but to me, the lectures provided me with zero information going into the exam preparation period.

### Exam

**Group Exam:** No

The exam was an 8-hour individual home exam, with two tasks consisting of many smaller tasks. We were assigned to analyze a dataset containing churn data from an insurance company. I really liked the exam, as it was sufficiently challenging while also providing interesting use-cases for the topics covered in the course. The exam was a clear highlight of the course.

Exam Grade: **A**

[Link to my exam in this course](https://github.com/sander-ed/nhh-course-help/tree/main/MASTER/BAN404/exam-V23-A)

### Review Summary

**Review Score:** ${\textbf{4/10}}$

Although I warmed up to the course in the last three weeks before my exam, I did not feel like the course fit in with the otherwise high quality courses in the BAN profile. It is not a bad course by any means, and you learn a lot of useful tools which are heavily used in data science. On the other hand, I feel that this course is a major waste of potential of what could be the most interesting course in the BAN major. I hope this is changed down the line, but at the moment I would not recommend anyone other than BAN majors to take this course.

## **[BAN438](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/application-development-in-python/) - Application Development in Python**

The goal of this course is relatively simple; create a visually pleasing and useful dashboard application which can be used to visualize a set of data. The main tool used for the course is Python (in the form of Jupyter Notebooks) and the Dash library. You learn how to import data by API, wrangle it with pandas, and deploy it in a web app created only with Python code. By taking the course you will also get some basic insight into the structure of a HTML website and tools such as Bootstrap, which can help in creating good looking dashboards for a potential end user.

### Learning Outcome

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

Although the course curriculum contains many useful skills and tools which are transferrable to other courses, I felt as though this was an "end-point" rather than a starting point for these skills. I used skills learned in other courses to excel in this course, not the other way around. This fact, combined with the fact that even though you get a good grasp of Python, the dash application is not very transferrable if you do not find it interesting enough to start creating you own custom websites with the knowledge aquired in HTML structuring.

### Coursework Amount

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

In order to get course approval, you needed to hand in one dash application prototype around the middle of the semester. I found this to be quite complicated, because I had not worked enough on the course before this mandatory assignment. This assignment was also given during the NHH Symposium, which did not help with my attention to the coursework. Overall, I would say that the coursework amount was very small, but the tasks which were given took some time to get the hang of.

### Difficulty

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

Most parts of the curriculum felt very easy to get a grasp of when coming from a BAN major background, but having had no previous experience with HTML, I found that some aspects of the Dash library was difficult to master. The main issue which I believe many struggled with was the callback functions in Dash. These emulate the syntax of actual HTML, which makes sense given that you are creating a web app. On the other hand, it felt very unnatural to retrieve and output data based on classes and HTML components instead of variables, and I would highly recommend that if you take this course, that you spend some time in the middle of the semester to get a solid grasp on this concept. I only got the hang of it around 4-5 days before the exam, which was not ideal.

### Required Code Knowledge

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

Previous experience in Python and HTML will help you a great deal in this course, although it is by no means mandatory. BAN436 was offered when I took this course, which acted as a introduction to Python in general, which was very useful in order to get me in the right headspace after not having coded in Python since my first semester at the bachelor level at NHH. I would reccomend BAN436 for nearly all students at NHH, but especially BAN students.

### Lecture Quality

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

The lecture material from this course was a clear highlight, as it took great inspiration from the interactive learning in BAN400. Although the lectures themselves was not very inspiring to say the least, the notebooks which the professor went through was very good, and I found it more efficient and useful to just work my way through the notebooks on my own, as it even contains small tasks which has to be completed throughout the notebooks.

### Exam

**Group Exam:** No

The exam was an 8 hour individual home exam, in which you had to replicate a currency exchange dashboard from _[Norges Bank](https://www.norges-bank.no/tema/Statistikk/Valutakurser/)_ using Dash and their API. The exam was graded stricly, as many of my co-students felt that they had handed in a "perfect" answer but did not get an A. This is also reflected in the grade distribution.

Exam Grade: **A**

### Review Summary

**Review Score:** ${\textbf{6/10}}$

All in all, the course was fun and the curriculum became the foundation of some of my personal projects which I made in the weeks after this exam, which could be considered a positive. However, I believe there are more courses with which teaches more useful skills than the ones taught in this course, which is why the score is lower than some other courses. All in all, I would recommend this course if you want to get better at Python and find creating visualizations fun and rewarding.

## **[STR459](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/artificial-intelligence-and-robotics/) - Artificial Intelligence and Robotics**

This course aims to give an introduction into various applications of AI and Machine Learning models. The course introduces the student to basic data wrangling in Python, some descriptive statistics and various ML models from the SKLearn package in Python. In addition to this there are some applications of Microsoft Azure and other cloud computing services where machine learning is applied to data such as images. This part of the course is very small however, and should be considered as a course where Python is the main tool used to conduct data analysis.

### Learning Outcome

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

The course offers a wide array of possible approaches, as the lectures vary in approaches to learning techniques, and the exam is in the form of a project freely chosen by the individual groups. This makes the spread in possible learning outcomes to be very wide, as I for example did not touch much of the actual machine learning parts of the course, and focused on writing the report and programming the descriptive statistics part of the project. A major upside of this course is that the is has some overlap with BAN404, which made me get a better understanding of the curriculum in that course than I would otherwise, which bumps this course rating up to a medium in learning outcome.

### Coursework Amount

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

There was no mandatory coursework except from the exam, which was handed out in march, and was due in april (45 days). My group made some poor choices in distributing the workload over the course of this period, and most of the project was therefore made during the last couple of days of the exam. The reasoning behind putting the coursework amount to high is that even though the exam can be completed in a somewhat timely manner, it took some very long days and a lit of trial and error to get successfull results, which made the amount of work feel quite large at times. If you distribute the load across the allocated 45 days however, the courseload amount could potential be put at a medium.

### Difficulty

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

ALthough the difficulty can be discussed in the same manner as the coursework amount, I would classify it at a medium, as the toughest parts of the course can become quite complicated quite fast, as one really needs to get a solid understanding of several machine learning models, how to use them in a practical setting and interpret the results in a way which relates to an actual business decision.

### Required Code Knowledge

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

The amount of programming experience needed for this course is set to a medium, mostly because some members of a group should be somewhat comfortable in Python, either having taken BAN436 or having had some previous experience. Other than this, all the key programming concepts in the course is gone through either at seminars or in the lectures. One thing to note is that 95% of the students which took this course in the Spring of 2023 were BAN majors, which might tip the scale in other directions other semesters where this might not be the case.

### Lecture Quality

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

The lectures were interesting and they went quite in-depth on some of the machine learning topics. The guest lectures were the highlight of this course, as the guests were highly distinguished in their field and provided great insight into the real world applications of AI and Machine Learning. The seminars could be improved a bit, as they often boiled down to doing a couple of tasks with a TA present then leaving without much interaction.

### Exam

**Group Exam:** Yes

The exam, as explained earlier, consisted of a creating a project chosen by the groups individually. This involved finding a dataset, and defining a couple of end goals which were the foundations of the analysis in the exam. It was tough choosing a task a first, but when we settled on our final idea it became much easier to work on the project.

Exam Grade: **A**

### Review Summary

**Rating:** ${\textbf{7/10}}$

This course was interesting to work on, and I believe that the curriculum has a plethora of transferrable skills within the BAN major, and it was here that I really learned how to write a good descriptive statistics section of a report. Other than the self-imposed strict time limit on the exam, I felt like this course was a nice experience overall, and I would recommend it to pretty much anyone at the NHH masters level if you are interested in learning more about Machine Learning.
