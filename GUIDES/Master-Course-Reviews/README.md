# Choosing courses for BAN master

Choosing courses for the Business Analytics major at NHH can be a difficult task which I personally experienced in August of 2022. As I knew very few people who had taken BAN as a major before I chose it as my major, I had a lot of questions which was left unanswered before the first lectures of BAN420. This **GUIDES** section of the GitHub-page is therefore dedicated to reviewing the courses I have taken, and explaining their various ins-and-outs which might make it easier to choose the ones that fit you, and making it easier to choose this techincal, but extremely fulfilling and useful major at NHH.

I have chosen to rate the various courses I have taken on several criteria in order to make it somewhat fair.

- Learning Outcome
- Coursework Amount
- Difficulty
- Required Code Knowledge
- Lecture Quality

I have also added a final score, and a section explaining the exam form.

Some categories are more important than others however. The learning outcome is extremely important to consider when choosing the BAN major, as there are many transferrable skills which can be applied to other courses. For example, I would have struggled a lot more with the descriptive statistics in STR459 had it not been for BAN432, and the thoroughness required to complete BAN402 made other courses like BAN400 seem less intimidating. All other categories somewhat speak for themselves.

The categories are divided into diffrent scores, on a range from ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$ to ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$.

**Category Scores**

| $${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$$ | $${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$$ | $${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$$ | $${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$$ |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------- |

This scale will be used to grade the various aspects of each course. The scores of the courses are weighed against each other. If a course has ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$ **Coursework Amount**, it does not mean that is has no coursework, just that is is low compared to the other possible courses which has been rated. The final review score is based upon my personal preference, and how much I enjoyed taking the course.

The courses I have taken at the masters level at NHH are the following:

## **[BAN400](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/r-programming-for-data-science/?displayNextTerm=True) - R Programming for Data Science**

BAN400 is acts as the introduction to data science at the masters level at NHH. It makes use of the open-source programming languange R in order to wrangle data sets, create graphic representations of data and give an introduction to bootstrapping and tree based machine learning models. R is familiar to students who took their bachelor degree at NHH, as it is one of the main tools used in the course MET4.

### Learning Outcome

**Rating:** ${\color{#e01010}VERY HIGH}$

The skills learning through this course was essential on my journey from programming and data science novice to a person who takes great interest in this subject area, and really sparked my enjoyment and interest in programming as a whole. I have used the things I learned in this course both directly and indirectly in all my other exams in my degree thus far.

### Coursework Amount

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

In order to be eligable for an exam in this course, you both needed to pass BAN420 (which in of itself was a 2.5 ECTS course) and complete 6 of 8 assignments during the semester. This might seem overwhelming, but the difficulty of the assignments were not very high, while they "forced" me to work on the course during the semester, which in hindsight is what increased my skill level neccesary to achieve an A in the course.

**! Note**: _BAN420 is no longer offered as of Fall 2023, which might change the course structure in this regard._

### Difficulty

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

I have chosen to rate the difficulty to medium, as much of the course was not very challenging. The challenge was the amount of work which had to be completed. I also found the exam we had (Fall 2022) to be above average difficulty, and much more difficult than the one used for the Fall 2021 exam (Which I used as exercice during my exam prep).

### Required Code Knowledge

**Rating:** ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$

This course is a "from-zero-to-hero" course, in the sense that it assumes no previous knowledge of the subjects which are gone through. Although basic code understanding is very useful in order to get started on the course material, it is not at all required. Many co-students I talked to went from almost no knowledge of programming to getting an A in this course.

### Lecture Quality

**Rating:** ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$

The lectures in this course really are the gold standard of lectures at NHH. Although it is hard to give credit to only one person for designing a course, the professor _[HÃ¥kon Otneim](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/hakon-otneim/)_ really is a gifted educator, and his passion is really evident throughout the various course material. I really felt like the professors wanted me to become great at a field they loved. It is no suprise he recently won the _[Inspirational Teaching Award](https://www.nhh.no/nhh-bulletin/artikkelarkiv/2022/juni/nhh-forskere-fikk-undervisningspris-pa-250-000-kroner/)_ award for innovative and overall great teaching at NHH.

### Exam

**Group Exam:** No

The exam was a 2,5 day exam at the end of December, in which a task was handed out individually at 09:00 on a monday, and was due at 14:15 the following wednesday. I really liked this format, which allowed me to be "stuck" at some parts and still prevail.

### Review Summary

**Review Score:** ${\textbf{9/10}}$

Having had many courses at NHH, I can honestly not reccomend this course enough. The only reason it has one less point than perfect is the fact that it might be difficult to combine with other majors, as it has a heavy courseload and requires a lot of attention to succeed. Other than that, I can only say positive things of this course if you are a prospective BAN student.

## **[BAN402](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/decision-modelling-in-business/) - Decision Modelling in Business**

BAN402 serves as an introduction to optimization at the masters level. The course is divided into three parts, each of which comes with their own 1 week exam. The three parts were Linear Programming, Integer and Mixed-Integer Models and Non-linear programming. IF you have taken BED4 at the bachelor level at NHH, you have gotten a taste of optimization, although this course takes it to another level. The main tool used in this course is [AMPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPL), a [algebraic modeling language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_modeling_language) which is a language designed for solving mathematical tasks. You use of the solvers IBM Cplex, Gurobi and MINOS to solve optimization tasks during the course, based on the problems you are solving.

### Learning Outcomes

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

This course dives relatively deep into real world use-cases for optimization, and I believe that you will get a above average understanding of how optimization is used, and how to use if if you take this course. It is also one of the most popular topics for writing your BAN master thesis. What pulls it down it that although the skills aquired in this course are very useful, they are not very transferrable to other courses in the BAN profile.

### Coursework Amount

**Rating:** ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$

Let's adress the elephant in the room. Yes, the amount of coursework needed to complete this course are is very high, if not more. The three weeks you spend solving the exams for this course are gruelling, and you will feel like you understand around 20% of everything you do during this time. When people say that the BAN profile is a heavy major, they are most likely referring to this course. On a positive note, you will feel an extreme sense of accomplishment when you deliver the third exam in this course, which personally made me feel like I could take on the world. If you want to get a better grasp of the type of work you will be doing, take a look [here](https://github.com/sander-ed/nhh-course-help/tree/main/MASTER/BAN402/exam-H22-A).

### Difficulty

**Rating:** ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$

Although the ideas at the centre of this course is relatively simple, the tasks which you will solve feel borderline impossible sometimes. On a positive note, if you feel like something is impossibly hard, your co-students will most likely feel the same, and in my experience you will be compensated in the grading of the exam.

### Required Code Knowledge

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

You do not need to know much code, as the AMPL language is highly mathematical in nature (the syntax is almost identical to actual optimization math notation). There was some tasks however which required you to use R or Python for a descriptive statistics part, which made me put this rating at medium.

### Lecture Quality

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

The professor in this course was _[Mario Guajardo](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/mario-guajardo/)_, who is an extremely talented researcher, and getting his insight into optimization was extremely helpful in understanding the practical application of the course material. On the other hand, the lectures were highly techincal, and I learned how to solve the tasks in the exam doing my own research, whilst attending very few lectures.

### Exam

**Group Exam:** Yes

The exam was split into three parts in groups of two. You could change partners during the course, but it was reccomended that you kept the same partner throughout. The first exam was from 15.09.2022 to 23.09.2022, the second exam was from 11.10.2022 to 19.10.2022 and the third exam was 01.11.2022 to 09.11.2022. The second exam was by far the most difficult, so don't make my mistake of being the group leader of Video at the SL Bergen Challange and being admitted to the hospital during this second examð
The exams were not graded individually, but together after the last exam, which led to a lot of tension, as you would have no idea of how well the exams went throughout the semester.

### Review Summary

**Review Score:** ${\textbf{7/10}}$

This course is the BAN majors "trial-by-fire" in my opinion, which might be seen as a bad thing by some. I believe that although it is tough, it is somewhing that makes the BAN major unique, as just having gone through this course with a good grade can be seen as a grat accomplishment. The quality of the course might not be top notch, but taking this course is something every BAN student can say they have overcome, which I think is a good thing overall.

## **[BAN432](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/applied-textual-data-analysis-for-business-and-finance/) - Applied Textual Data Analysis for Business and Finance**

BAN432 is a course which aims to give the student a good understanding of how to process large amounts of text in a structural and useful manner, in order to provide a framework to make better business decisions. You make use of R where you learn to use APIs, use sentiment analysis, tokenization and much more.
