# Choosing courses for BAN master

Choosing courses for the Business Analytics major at NHH can be a difficult task, which I personally experienced in August of 2022. As I knew very few people who had taken BAN as a major before I chose it as my major, I had a lot of questions which was left unanswered before the first lectures of BAN420. This **GUIDES** section of the GitHub-page is therefore dedicated to reviewing the corses I have taken, and explaining the various ins-and-outs of the courses which might make it easier to choose the ones that fit you, and making it easier to choose this techincal, but extremely fulfilling and useful major at NHH.

The courses I have taken at the masters level at NHH are the following:

**Category Scores**

| $${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$$ | $${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$$ | $${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$$ | $${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$$ |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------- |

This scale will be used to grade the various aspects of each course. The scores of the courses are weighed against each other. If a course has ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$ **Coursework Amount**, it does not mean that is has no coursework, just that is is low compared to the other possible courses which has been rated. The final review score is based upon my personal preference, and how much I enjoyed taking the course.

## Course Ratings
