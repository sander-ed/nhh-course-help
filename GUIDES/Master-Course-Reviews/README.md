# Choosing courses for BAN master

Choosing courses for the Business Analytics major at NHH can be a difficult task which I personally experienced in August of 2022. As I knew very few people who had taken BAN as a major before I chose it as my major, I had a lot of questions which was left unanswered before the first lectures of BAN420. This **GUIDES** section of the GitHub-page is therefore dedicated to reviewing the courses I have taken, and explaining their various ins-and-outs which might make it easier to choose the ones that fit you, and making it easier to choose this techincal, but extremely fulfilling and useful major at NHH.

I have chosen to rate the various courses I have taken on several criteria in order to make it somewhat fair. Some categories are more important than others however. The learning outcome is extremely important to consider when choosing the BAN major, as there are many transferrable skills which can be applied to other courses. For example, I would have struggled a lot more with the descriptive statistics in STR459 had it not been for BAN432, and the thoroughness required to complete BAN402 made other courses like BAN400 seem less intimidating. All other categories somewhat speak for themselves.

The categories are divided into diffrent scores, on a range from ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$ to ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$.

**Category Scores**

| $${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$$ | $${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$$ | $${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$$ | $${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$$ |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------- |

This scale will be used to grade the various aspects of each course. The scores of the courses are weighed against each other. If a course has ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$ **Coursework Amount**, it does not mean that is has no coursework, just that is is low compared to the other possible courses which has been rated. The final review score is based upon my personal preference, and how much I enjoyed taking the course.

The courses I have taken at the masters level at NHH are the following:

## Course Ratings

| :----- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| BAN400 | $${\color{#e01010}VERY HIGH}$$ | $${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$$ | $${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$$    | $${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$$    | $${\color{#e01010}VERY HIGH}$$ | $${\textbf{No}}$$  | $${\textbf{9/10}}$$ |
| BAN402 | $${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$$      | $${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$$ | $${\color{#e01010}VERY HIGH}$$ | $${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$$   | $${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$$      | $${\textbf{Yes}}$$ | $${\textbf{7/10}}$$ |
| BAN432 | $${\color{#e01010}VERY HIGH}$$ | $${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$$ | $${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$$    | $${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$$ | $${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$$    | $${\textbf{Yes}}$$ | $${\textbf{5/10}}$$ |

## **BAN400 - R Programming for Data Science**

BAN400 is acts as the introduction to data science at the masters level at NHH. It makes use of the open-source programming languange R in order to wrangle data sets, create graphic representations of data and give an introduction to bootstrapping and tree based machine learning models. R is familiar to students who took their bachelor degree at NHH, as it is one of the main tools used in the course MET4.

### Learning Outcome

**Rating:** ${\color{#e01010}VERY HIGH}$

The skills learning through this course was essential on my journey from programming and data science novice to a person who takes great interest in this subject area, and really sparked my enjoyment and interest in programming as a whole. I have used the things I learned in this course both directly and indirectly in all my other exams in my degree thus far.

### Coursework Amount

**Rating:** ${\color{#e87910}HIGH}$

In order to be eligable for an exam in this course, you both needed to pass BAN420 (which in of itself was a 2.5 ECTS course) and complete 6 of 8 assignments during the semester. This might seem overwhelming, but the difficulty of the assignments were not very high, while they "forced" me to work on the course during the semester, which in hindsight is what increased my skill level neccesary to achieve an A in the course.

### Difficulty

**Rating:** ${\color{#1d9908}MEDIUM}$

I have chosen to rate the difficulty to medium, as much of the course was not very challenging. The challenge was the amount of work which had to be completed. I also found the exam we had (Fall 2022) to be above average difficulty, and much more difficult than the one used for the Fall 2021 exam (Which I used as exercice during my exam prep).

### Required Code Knowledge

**Rating:** ${\color{#5ae342}LOW}$

This course is a "from-zero-to-hero" course, in the sense that it assumes no previous knowledge of the subjects which are gone through. Although basic code understanding is very useful in order to get started on the course material, it is not at all required. Many co-students I talked to went from almost no knowledge of programming to getting an A in this course.

### Lecture Quality

**Rating:** ${\color{#bf0000}VERY HIGH}$

The lectures in this course really are the gold standard of lectures at NHH. Although it is hard to give credit to only one person for designing a course, the professor _HÃ¥kon Otneim_ really is a gifted educator, and his passion is really evident throughout the various course material. I really felt like the professors wanted me to become great at a field they loved. It is no suprise he recently won the _Bronsesvampen_ award for great teaching at NHH.

### Exam

**Group Exam:** No

The exam was a 2,5 day exam at the end of December, in which a task was handed out individually at 09:00 on a monday, and was due at 14:15 the following wednesday. I really liked this format, which allowed me to be "stuck" at some parts and still prevail.

### Review Summary

**Review Score:** ${\textbf{9/10}}$

Having had many courses at NHH, I can honestly not reccomend this course enough. The only reason it has one less point than perfect is the fact that it might be difficult to combine with other majors, as it has a heavy courseload and requires a lot of attention to succeed in. Other than that, I can only say positive things of this course if you are a prospective BAN student.

## **BAN402 - Decision Modelling in Business**

BAN402 serves as an introduction to optimization at the masters level. The course is divided into three parts, each of which comes with their own 1 week exam. The three parts were Linear Programming, Integer and Mixed-Integer Models and Non-linear programming.
