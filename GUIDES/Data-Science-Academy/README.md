# The Data Science Academy

Hi! My name is Sander, and I'm a fifth-year student at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH). Navigating through the breadth and diversity of courses during my undergraduate years was quite challenging. With such a wide range of subjects, truly mastering the essential elements of each course often felt like a formidable task. Through countless interactions with my peers, it became evident that many shared this sense of academic disorientation.

Transitioning to the Business Analytics major at NHH marked a significant turning point in my academic journey. The allure of programming, the intrigue of delving into data, and the compelling nature of the coursework not only captivated me but also inspired me to do great in these courses. Recognizing that many students might be struggling with choosing their major or apprehensive about the perceived difficulty of Business Analytics, I felt compelled to share my experiences and insights.

The goal of this section is to provide some guidelines as to how one can improve ones programming skills, provide some tasks which can be used for practice, list some great resources for learning and finally give some tips heading into an eventual exam.

# R Training Tasks

This section is dedicated to creating some tasks which can be completed in order to get better at programming and data science in general. I would recommend that you try to solve the tasks yourself, and then look at my proposed solutions to the tasks. Some of the tasks might seem easy, some might seem hard. Either way, I believe that you will find yourself getting better for each solved task (as long as you don't rely too heavily on ChatGPTðŸ˜…)
