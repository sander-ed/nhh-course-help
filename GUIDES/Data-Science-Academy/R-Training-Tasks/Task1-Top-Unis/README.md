# Task 1 - Top Universities Dataset

This task will make use of a data set containing information about several top universities in the world, where they are ranked according to enrollment numbers. The data used for this task is a data set gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drahulsingh/top-largest-universities). If you are unable to download the data set from this link, you can find the data in the "data" folder in the [Task1](https://github.com/sander-ed/nhh-course-help/blob/main/GUIDES/Data-Science-Academy/R-Training-Tasks/Task1-Top-Unis/data/Top-Largest-Universities.csv) folder.

In order to complete this task, you must complete four objectives in order. These are as follows:

Objectives:

- **Objective 1:** Remove observations where "Distance/In-person" is not equal to "In-Person"
- **Objective 2:** Show the average number of students enrolled based on the continent of the Institutions, and sort from high to low.
- **Objective 3:** Expand the previous table, where you also show the number of observed Institutions from each continent
- **Objective 4:** Create a new table where the private institution percentage of the total is shown per continent

You can find the solution proposal in the **[solution]** folder in this repository.
