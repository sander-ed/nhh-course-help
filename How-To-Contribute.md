# How can I contribute to this?

Embracing active learning is an essential step in mastering new skills and knowledge. The cycle of attempting a task, stumbling, and then understanding the correct solution offers a powerful and efficient learning experience. It is through this process that we truly absorb new information and understand its application.

In the spirit of fostering collective knowledge growth, we subscribe to the philosophy of leaving our peers more informed and capable than before. If you find yourself with insights or resources that could benefit this repository, your contributions are highly welcome.

Outlined below, you'll find the guidelines on how to effectively contribute to our repository. Let's engage in this cooperative learning journey together. Remember to keep in mind the [Licence](https://github.com/sander-ed/nhh-course-help/blob/main/Licence.md) agreement if you are to add something to this repository. You can get a more thorough walkthrough of the techincal details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

## Step 1: Fork the repository

If you press the "Fork" button on this repository, you will be able to create your own version of the data stored in the repository. Here you can make any changes you like, but I will only accept:

- New A or B answers to an exam at the masters level at NHH
- New tasks created by you for the Code Academy
- New Reviews of masters courses
- New learning resources you have found

## Step 2: Create anew branch to work on

Now you can create a new branch to work on, and the name of this branch should be something other than _main_.

## Step 3: Create a pull request and wait for me to accept

Pretty self explanatory, you can look at the thorough guide to see how to submit a pull request!

Congratulations! You have now made the life of a future masters student at NHH easier!
